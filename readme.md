<strong><h2>How to use this project?</h2></strong>


<p>
To run the project you can just open the index.html
file in your browser. However, if you make any changes,
you have to recompile and bundle the project. To do that,
run the build script. To do this automatically, run the
watch script. Before you run any of the scripts, you have to
install the following plugins.
</p>

<strong>Plugins:</strong> <br />
browserify [bundles source files] <br />
watchify [watches for changes] <br />
babel [transpiler] <br />

<strong>Notes:</strong> <br />
The build-js script does not work yet.
